## Why learn Java the hard way ##


--------------------------------------------
## Exercise 0: Setting Things Up ##

### On Windows Operating System ###

1. Java 6 JDK - Visit the [Java SE Downloads](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html) link and download the JDK for the latest version of Java Platform, Standard Edition 6. Select the files for your platform Windows x86 (for 32 bit Windows systems) and Windows x64 (for 64 bit systems). The files downloaded will be of the format jdk-6u<N>-windows-i586.exe or jdk-6u<N>-windows-x64.exe for 32 bit and 64 bit systems respectively.

Once the JDK is downloaded install it in your windows machine in the location *C:\jdk6*. We will assume that this is your JDK installation directory from here on and will be indicated by __JAVA_HOME__

2. For working on the code samples, and writing Java code, use a text editor of your liking - Notepad, Textpad, Notepad++ etc. preferably with the code completion feature turned off. The reason being, it will help you learn the syntax, rather than the IDE / editor completing the syntax for you. This book assumes that your source code and all the Java files that your write will reside in the folder *C:\code\java* and will be indicated by __SRC__
